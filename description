here we create a mock bank where each user has an associated balance the bank should be able to give out notification when there
is a successful transaction to notify the user of it.

first an object is created to represent the bank user with the following fields user's fullname banking password , and unque account number,

then a send function that can be called by the user ,
 and a receive function that listens for send function calls
the receive function is such that it is capable of sending a notification via websockets which the consumer(frontend or mock payment server) consumes
the mock payment server receives this notification verifies it's  and
return a value with of { status : "error or success", transactionId : "", hex: "" , timestamp: "", protocol_signature : ""  }
if the status is successful the protocol performs a check to see if the transaction was signed by the protocol and if
hex exist already if it does not then the transaction goes through and all other
transaction with the same hex reverts to avoid double spending.
